# TicTacToe
A program allows a 1 or 2 player version of tic tac toe in Python, played entirely on the console so no additional downloads necessary.

You can choose to to play against 3 difficulties if in 1 player mode, with 3 types of algorithms based on difficulty.
The hardest one uses a min max algorithm for the computer so they can never lose.
